## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The BioLink web app was designed with the future in mind; the future where every individual would be equipped with computer implants that would send their biological data to our app. For the purpose of this project, we had created a mockdata on MongoDB to act as such computer implant. Using our app today currently just requires either creating an account or logging in with an existing account. It should be noted that the mockdata established on our database on exists for the dummy account created for project assessment. 
#### Entering the web app
1. Create an account
   1. Verify email
   2. Set up security questions
   3. Add details to profile
2. Log in using existing account
